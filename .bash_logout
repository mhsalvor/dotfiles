# Wrtitten to work on *most* GNU/Linux distributions.
# Things not working or WIP are commented out. Unless I forgot.
# Much of what follows has been "stolen" from many places over the years and
# tweaked to suit my workflow and personal preferences; feel free to do the same.
#
# Remember, like with all of my work, I am only able to provide the following
# assurance(s):
# It is almost certainly going to work until it breaks; although I have to
# admit it may never work and that would be sad.
# When/if it does break, you may keep all of the pieces.
# If you find my materials helpful, both you & I will be happy, at least for a
# little while.
# My advice is worth every penny you paid for it!
